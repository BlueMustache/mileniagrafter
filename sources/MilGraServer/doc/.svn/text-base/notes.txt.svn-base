- fms connection nem mukodik
- seek/speed nem mukodik
- reject ket szerver kozott nem mukodik, packetkent kene kezelni a szakadast

- handshake class first from connection, if hs is okay, then init clinet
if not okay, check for 0 - shutdown, or check for flood - deny

- throguhput test with non-blocking sockets
- consider bytearrayoutputstream for decoder
- write unit tester app for fms also, check traffic
- test handshakes, with rtmpe also
- handshake flood, freeze
- stream events to streams

- close-closed-destruct
- reject - close sorrend
- linket az appletekbe
- cam.setQuality(131072,0); amit kilehet sávszélből hozni
- NetStream.Publish.BadName message
- getRouters, getPlayers a unit tesztbe  

- rtmp channel kiosztas encoderbe
- player, router name check

-mp4 stream playing
-flash live encoder authorization module
-RTMPE support

unit is a good example for every feature of the server, and also a good example on how to connect as modules and milenia modules
check for manifest main class on app load, if there is no, load app.App

0 and 1 are prefix to either 8 bit and 16 bit channels

you can have 32768 channels with rtmp

oh god, that maxes sense!

and latest flash will test for it sometimes, and not work with server if not handled correctly
Milan Toth
11:14 PM
yeah, i faced that in february
11:14 PM
 
and i thought it is a modifier
Ashod
11:14 PM
i went crazy trying to work it out -
11:15 PM
 
if channel is 0 , then read next 7 bits for channnel, if channel is 1 , read next 15 bits for channel



module based structure
rtmpe - rtmpt -> rtmp -> amf -> client / stream -> customapp/flvstream/h264stream/vp6stream

rtmp module should do rtmp functions - ping, byterread, etc, it should receive stream
packets by stream id - can asssign them channels or extend channels if there is too much
